# ActiView

Most apps that I develop require an active internet connect, and most times it is a pain to check the connection status evertime the user enters a view that requires internet. ActiView is an example project that uses Apple's Reachability class to monitor the NSNotificationCenter monitor the internet status and show a dropdown animation whenever the internet connection is lost.
